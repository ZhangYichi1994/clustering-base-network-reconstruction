CBA method mentioned in Y. Zhang, C. Yang, K. Huang, M. Jusup, Z. Wang and X. Li, "Reconstructing Heterogeneous Networks via Compressive Sensing and Clustering," in IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence, doi: 10.1109/TETCI.2020.2997011.

main.m is the main function file of clear observation data
mainwwithNoise.m is the main function file of noise polluted observation data.

basic_pursuit_box.m and lasso_box.m are CBM in clear environment and noise environment, respectively.
